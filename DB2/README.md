# DB2 Export Scripts

This repository provides some simple scripts to help exporting your DB2 code so it can be migrated to [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) using [SnowConvert](https://docs.snowconvert.com/snowconvert/for-db2/introduction)

## Version

Release 2023-02-28

## Usage

The following are the steps to execute the DDL Code Generation. They can be executed in Linux/Unix enviroments.

## **For Linux/Unix:**

1 - Modify `create_ddls.sh` located in the `bin` folder. 
Using a text editor modify the following parameters:

    * `DATABASES_TO_EXCLUDE`

That variable will determine if there are any database that you want to exclude from the extraction

**It is required to use a user  with administrative privileges (DBA)** and to run on a production-like environment with recently up to date statistics.


2 - After modifying, the `create_ddls.sh` file can be run from the command line to execute the extract.  The following files will be created in the directory `/object_extracts/DDL`:

3 - Run `create_ddls.sh --version` to check the current version of the extraction scripts.

## **For Windows:**

1 - Modify `create_ddls.ps1` located in the `bin` folder. 
Using a text editor modify the following parameters:

    * `DATABASES_TO_EXCLUDE`

That variable will determine if there are any database that you want to exclude from the extraction

**It is required to use a user  with administrative privileges (DBA)** and to run on a production-like environment with recently up to date statistics.


2 - After modifying, the `create_ddls.ps1` file can be run from the command line to execute the extract.  The following files will be created in the directory `/object_extracts/DDL`:


### DDL Files
For each database a folder with the database name and a file called `DDL_All.sql` will be generated. It will contain the definitions of the objects in the database.

### Reports

For each database some volumetrics reports will be created:

- `volumetrics_per_object.txt` 
- `volumetrics_per_database.txt`
- `db_size.txt`
